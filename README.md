# bhvr 🦫

![cover](https://cdn.stevedylan.dev/ipfs/bafybeievx27ar5qfqyqyud7kemnb5n2p4rzt2matogi6qttwkpxonqhra4)

A full-stack TypeScript monorepo starter with shared types, using Bun, Hono, Vite, and React

## Why bhvr?

While there are plenty of existing app building stacks out there, many of them are either bloated, outdated, or have too much of a vendor lock-in. bhvr is built with the opinion that you should be able to deploy your client or server in any environment while also keeping type saftey.

## Features

- **Full-Stack TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety between client and server
- **Shared Types**: Common type definitions shared between client and server
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized as a workspaces-based monorepo
- **Modern Stack**:
  - [Bun](https://bun.sh) as the JavaScript runtime
  - [Hono](https://hono.dev) as the backend framework
  - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for frontend bundling
  - [React](https://react.dev) for the frontend UI

## Project Structure

```
.
├── client/               # React frontend
├── server/               # Hono backend
├── shared/               # Shared TypeScript definitions
│   └── src/types/        # Type definitions used by both client and server
└── package.json          # Root package.json with workspaces
```

### Server

bhvr uses Hono as a backend API for it's simplicity and massive ecosystem of plugins. If you have ever used Express then it might feel familiar. Declaring routes and returning data is easy.

```
server
├── bun.lock
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── src
│   └── index.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

```typescript src/index.ts
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { cors } from 'hono/cors'
import type { ApiResponse } from 'shared/dist'

const app = new Hono()

app.use(cors())

app.get('/', (c) => {
  return c.text('Hello Hono!')
})

app.get('/hello', async (c) => {

  const data: ApiResponse = {
    message: "Hello BHVR!",
    success: true
  }

  return c.json(data, { status: 200 })
})

export default app
```

If you wanted to add a database to Hono you can do so with a multitude of Typescript libraries like [Supabase](https://supabase.com), or ORMs like [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started) or [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/orm)

### Client

bhvr uses Vite + React Typescript template, which means you can build your frontend just as you would with any other React app. This makes it flexible to add UI components like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) or routing using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/start/declarative/installation).

import beaver from './assets/beaver.svg'

import './App.css'

const SERVER_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_SERVER_URL || "http://localhost:3000"

function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState<ApiResponse | undefined>()

  async function sendRequest() {
    try {
      const req = await fetch(`${SERVER_URL}/hello`)
      const res: ApiResponse = await req.json()
      setData(res)
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error)
    }
  }

  return (

      <div>
        <a href="https://github.com/stevedylandev/bhvr" target="_blank">
          <img src={beaver} className="logo" alt="beaver logo" />
        </a>
      </div>
      <h1>bhvr</h1>
      <h2>Bun + Hono + Vite + React</h2>
      <p>A typesafe fullstack monorepo</p>
      <div className="card">
        <button onClick={sendRequest}>
          Call API
        </button>
        {data && (
          <pre className='response'>
            <code>
            Message: {data.message} <br />
            Success: {data.success.toString()}
            </code>
          </pre>
        )}
      </div>
      <p className="read-the-docs">
        Click the beaver to learn more
      </p>
    </>
  )
}

export default App
```

### Shared

The Shared package is used for anything you want to share between the Server and Client. This could be types or libraries that you use in both the enviorments.

```
shared
├── package.json
├── src
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── types
│       └── index.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

Inside the `src/index.ts` we export any of our code from the folders so it's usabe in other parts of the monorepo

```typescript
export * from "./types"
```

By running `bun run dev` or `bun run build` it will compile and export the packages from `shared` so it can be used in either `client` or `server`

```typescript
import { ApiResponse } from 'shared'
```

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

You can start a new bhvr project using the [CLI](https://github.com/stevedylandev/create-bhvr)

```bash
bun create bhvr
```

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies for all workspaces
bun install
```

### Development

```bash
# Run shared types in watch mode, server, and client all at once
bun run dev

# Or run individual parts
bun run dev:shared  # Watch and compile shared types
bun run dev:server  # Run the Hono backend
bun run dev:client  # Run the Vite dev server for React
```

### Building

```bash
# Build everything
bun run build

# Or build individual parts
bun run build:shared  # Build the shared types package
bun run build:client  # Build the React frontend
```

### Deployment

Deplying each piece is very versatile and can be done numerous ways, and exploration into automating these will happen at a later date. Here are some references in the meantime.

- [Node.js](https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/nodejs)

## Type Sharing

Types are automatically shared between the client and server thanks to the shared package and TypeScript path aliases. You can import them in your code using:

```typescript
import { ApiResponse } from '@shared/types';
```
